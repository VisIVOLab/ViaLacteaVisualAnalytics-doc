The 3D visualization can be performed by clicking on the :guilabel:`Select` button of the Main Window (see :numref:`main-window`) and then typing the region bounds (in degrees) of the area of interest.

    3D Visualization of sources on galactic plane

The 3D view is interactive and the camera position can be moved with mouse operations. The color palette can be mapped to a pre-defined field (e.g. temperature) in the :guilabel:`Lut` box in the top panel. The scale and range values can also be changed.

The shape and the scaling factor of each source can be modified in the :guilabel:`Glyph` panel. The points are scaled based on the selected field (e.g. mass). The maximum number of glyphs visualized is set in the Settings (:numref:`setting-window`).
