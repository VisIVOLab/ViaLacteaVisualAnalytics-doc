Introduction
============
The ViaLactea Software is developed in two main components: the ViaLactea Knowledge Base (following referred as VLKB) and the ViaLactea Visual Analytics (following referred as VLVA).

The VLKB documentation is available `here <https://vlkb.readthedocs.io/>`_.

VLVA is based on the VisIVO suite and offers a 2D and 3D visual analytics environment allowing the astronomers to easily conduct research activities interacting in a simple way with the VLKB and its services.

For more details about the ViaLactea Visual Analytics Tool and its aspects please refere to `F. Vitello et al. 2018 PASP 130 084503 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/aac5d2>`_.
